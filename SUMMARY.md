# Travel App with AI: Project Summary

## Project Status
The Travel App with AI project has established a solid foundation with Clean Architecture principles. The backend follows a structured approach with distinct layers, and development has progressed through the Domain and Application layers with initial work on key services.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Work
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Full Clean Architecture setup with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers
- ✅ **Domain Model**: Complete set of domain entities, repository interfaces, and domain exceptions
- ✅ **Application Layer**: DTOs, mapping profiles, and initial service implementations
- ✅ **Frontend Setup**: Next.js application with TypeScript configuration

### Key Features Implemented
- User registration and authentication
- Profile and preference management
- Itinerary creation and manipulation
- Itinerary versioning system
- Template functionality
- AI-generation interface design

### Technical Implementations
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Service layer for business logic
- Detailed error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- MongoDB integration setup
- Mapping between domain entities and DTOs
- Input validation and business rule enforcement

## Next Steps

### Backend Development
1. Complete remaining service implementations (DestinationService)
2. Implement MongoDB repositories for all entities
3. Set up JWT authentication
4. Create API endpoints with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs
5. Implement AI integration for itinerary generation

### Frontend Development 
1. Develop API client services
2. Create authentication context and flows
3. Build UI components following the design standards
4. Implement itinerary creation and management interface

## Architecture Insights
The implemented architecture follows best practices with:
- Clear separation of concerns between layers
- Domain-driven design principles
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection for service management
- Comprehensive error handling strategy

## Technical Debt
- AI generation service implementation details need to be finalized
- Authentication service requires JWT implementation
- Repository implementations need MongoDB integration
- Email verification functionality to be completed
- External service clients (maps, weather) need implementation

## Documentation Updates
All project documentation has been maintained and updated with:
- Implementation details and patterns observed
- Code conventions established during development
- Current task status and priorities
- Development history tracking
