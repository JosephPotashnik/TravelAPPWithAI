# Travel App with AI: Project Summary

## Project Status
The Travel App with AI project has established a solid foundation with Clean Architecture principles. The backend follows a structured approach with distinct layers, and development has progressed through the Domain and Application layers with comprehensive service implementations.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Work
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Full Clean Architecture setup with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers
- ✅ **Domain Model**: Complete set of domain entities, repository interfaces, and domain exceptions
- ✅ **Application Layer**: DTOs, mapping profiles, and service implementations
- ✅ **Frontend Setup**: Next.js application with TypeScript configuration

### Key Features Implemented
- User registration, authentication, and profile management
- Preference system with diverse travel preferences
- Itinerary creation, management, versioning, and templating
- Comprehensive destination search with multiple filtering criteria
- Geospatial search for nearby points of interest
- Personalized recommendation engines for destinations
- Transportation options between destinations
- Integration points for weather data and travel advisories

### Technical Implementations
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Service layer for business logic
- Detailed error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Mapping between domain entities and DTOs
- Input validation and business rule enforcement
- Scoring algorithms for recommendations
- Geographical distance calculations

## Next Steps

### Backend Development
1. Implement MongoDB repositories for all entities
2. Set up JWT authentication
3. Create API endpoints with ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs
4. Implement AI integration for itinerary generation
5. Develop external service integrations (weather, travel advisories)

### Frontend Development 
1. Develop API client services
2. Create authentication context and flows
3. Build UI components following the design standards
4. Implement itinerary creation and management interface

## Architecture Insights
The implemented architecture follows best practices with:
- Clear separation of concerns between layers
- Domain-driven design principles
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection for service management
- Comprehensive error handling strategy

## Technical Debt
- Repository implementations need MongoDB integration
- Authentication service requires JWT implementation
- Email verification functionality to be completed
- External service clients (maps, weather) need implementation

## Documentation Updates
All project documentation has been maintained and updated with:
- Implementation details and patterns observed
- Code conventions established during development
- Current task status and priorities
- Development history tracking
